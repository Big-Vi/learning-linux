# Rust Learning
## Int
i8, u8, etc

## Float
f32(single precision) - f64(double precision)
f64 - can't store pi value

Guidelines
f64 is faster?

## Arithmatic operations
PEMDAS

## Casting weirdness
3 as f64 -> 3.0
3.9 as i32 -> 3
300 as u8 -> 44
-300 as u32 -> 4294966996

## Formatting print statements

## Bitwise operator
Manipulating individual bits - Clear/Get specific field or get boolean whether it's 1 or 0. sequence of bits used to manipulate is called bit mask.
Embedded system - AND, OR, NOR

Use case:
Low level programming
compression and encryption algorithms.
 color manipulation and collision detection - Gaming And graphic

`cargo run`
